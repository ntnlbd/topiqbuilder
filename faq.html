      <h3>How many times can I take the official Intelluni IQ test?</h3>
      <p>You can take it as many times as you want. Your last IQ score will be the one showing in the IQ Centre. Each test will cost you 1 credit. You receive free credits at the beginning of each month with your membership. You can also purchase them if you run out.<p>

      <h3>Are the answers of the official Intelluni IQ test always in the same order?</h3>
      <p>No, we rotate the possible answers each time you retake the test so the right answer is never in the same place as the previous time you took it.</p>

      <h3>How can I check the right answers of the official Intelluni IQ test?</h3>
      <p>You cannot but what you can do is train in the IQ Centre and take the test again on a regular basis. If you train enough, you should be able to improve your score.</p>

      <h3>How much does time influence my overall score?</h3>
      <p>Timing has quite an influence on your overall score so answer the questions as quickly as possible.</p>

      <h3>Do I lose points by answering wrongly?</h3>
      <p>No you do not. We do not apply negative scoring.</p>

      <h3>How serious is your test?</h3>
      <p>Our IQ test was written specifically for Intelluni by a certified psychologist and psychometric specialist.</p>

      <h3>Where can I find the certificate and the analysis of my IQ test?</h3>
      <p>In the Tests Centre, you have access to the certificate and the analysis of the last IQ test you took. You will be able to retrieve the certificate and analysis of your previous results in the email which is sent to the email address you registered with us each time you complete a test.</p>
    </div>
    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="benchmark-tab">
      <h3> How do I benchmark myself against a friend?</h3>
      <p>Go the IQ Centre and enter the email address of the friend you would like to benchmark against in the “You VS Friend” section (top right of the page)</p>
      <h3>What if my friend hasn’t taken the official Intelluni IQ test yet?</h3>
      <p>If we cannot find your friend in our database, we will give you the option to invite him/her to take the test. Just follow the simple steps.</p>
      <h3>How do I add a friend to my IQ distribution graph?</h3>
      <p>Once our system has benchmarked your friend’s result in the spider graph, it will add it automatically in your IQ distribution graph. However, please note that this will only happen once you have refreshed the IQ Centre by either navigating away and coming back to it or by clicking the refresh button in your browser.</p>
      <h3>What if I do not want to allow people to see my score and benchmark themselves against me?</h3>
      <p>You have the option to opt out of the benchmarking functionality. Go to your account (Hello “your name”! in the menu at the top right of your page) and untick the box “Allow Benchmarking”. You will then become invisible and no one will be able to see your results and benchmark against them.</p>
    </div>
    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="training-tab">
      <h3>How can I train?</h3>
      <p>At the top left centre of the IQ centre, you can find your score per reasoning skill in percentile and represented by a bar. In front of this bar, you will see a “Train Me” button. Click on the button corresponding to whichever skill you wish to train and a training test will start.</p>
      <h3>Can I check the right answers of the training questions?</h3>
      <p>Yes you can. Please go to “Your Training Progress” section at the bottom right of the IQ Centre. On the graph which shows the training tests you have taken, click on the test you are interested in. The test questions will appear again showing you what you answered, which was the right answer and a tip to help you understand the reasoning behind the right answer.</p>
      <h3>How often can I train?</h3>
      <p>You can train as much and as often as you want. We believe that the more you train, the more likely you will be to considerably improve your official Intelluni IQ score.</p>
    </div>
    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="progress-tab">
      <h3>How do I check my IQ progress?</h3>
      <p>At the bottom left of the IQ Centre you can find a section called “Your Official IQ Progress”. This section tracks every official Intelluni IQ test that you have taken so far. It shows you the date you took it and the score you achieved per reasoning skill.</p>
    </div>
    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="additional-tab">
      <h3>Where can I find additional tests?</h3>
      <p>You can find a growing list of additional certified tests such as an EQ Test, a 16 personality test, a career test, etc… in the Tests Centre.</p>
      <h3>How can I find the analysis and certificate of the tests I have taken?</h3>
      <p>In the Tests Centre, you have access to the certificate and the analysis of the last version of the tests you already took. You will be able to retrieve the certificate and analysis of your previous results in the email which is sent to you each time you complete a test (to the email address you registered with us).</p>
    </div>
    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="membership-tab">

      <h3>How can I cancel my membership?</h3>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="credits-tab">
      <h3>What are the credits for?</h3>
      <p>You need 1 credit per test that you take. You membership comes with free credits which you can use during the month. If you run out of them, you can either wait for the new credits you will get with your next month’s membership or you can purchase them in the IQ Centre.</p>
      <h3>Do credits expire at the end of the month if I haven’t used them?</h3>
      <p>No, your credits are carried over to your next month so you are able to use them any time as long as you have an active membership.</p>
      <h3>Do I lose my credits if I cancel my membership?</h3>
      <p>Yes, your credits will expire at the end of your last month of active membership. Once your membership expires, your credits will become null and void.</p>
      <h3>Are credits redeemable, transferable and/or refundable?</h3>
