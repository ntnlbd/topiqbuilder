        <h4>Speed do not matter</h4>
        <p>This score gives you a snapshot of your General Mental Ability and assesses your mental capacity across a wide range of different intellectual functions and modalities. It is a composite of the speed and accuracy with which you perform mental tasks and it is based on combined results across the verbal, numerical, spatial and abstract test questions. This report provides information on how you performed on each of the above categories. Your total score indicates that you achieved a low score which means you scored lower than other people who took the same test. Detailed analysis of each of the subcategories will inform you of your relative strengths and weaknesses across the different areas of aptitude along with suggestions and tips on how to improve your general mental ability.</p>

        <h3>Abstract subscale interpretations</h3>

        <p class="lead">Below average score</p>
        <h4>Speed does not matter</h4>
        <p>The abstract reasoning test assesses your logical, analytical and conceptual skills. It evaluates people’s ability to perceive patterns among complex ideas and elements and relate them to each other. As a measure, it is independent of educational attainments and it can reveal people’s intellectual potential. Your score on this test was relatively low compared to the reference group. Your results indicate that you experienced a significant difficulty to use pure logic without calling upon other knowledge and correctly deduce the logical consequences of complex abstract patterns and relationships. This means that although you usually work out problems for yourself, you often cannot deal with ideas that are not fully explained or precise.  You often need to spend a lot of effort and time in order to get along with courses or occupations that require the ability to see relationships among objects in terms of their size, shape, position and quantities or put abstract ideas in a conceptual context.</p>

        <p>Ways to improve your performance in abstract reasoning tests and your abstract skills in general could include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Spend some time to focus on the question and make sure you understand what you are being asked to do</li>
          <li>Identify patterns that are useful to complete other similar questions</li>
          <li>Break the question into smaller, more manageable pieces to help you better understand what you need to do</li>
          <li>Practice by solving logical games and puzzles</li>
          <li>Spend some time examining information that is presented in abstract forms</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You will be able to benefit from training materials once you are a member of the <a href="">Intelluni Intelligence Club</a>. You will have the chance to practice with relationships, connections and sequences which should help you improve both your accuracy and speed not only in this kind of tests but also in your life in general.</p>

        <p class="lead">Below average score</p>
        <h4>Speed does not matter</h4>
        <p>The numerical reasoning test assesses your ability to use numbers in a logical and rational way. The test consists of items which assess the candidate's understanding of number series, numerical transformations, relationships between numbers and figures and their ability to perform numerical computations. Your score on this test was relatively low compared to the reference group. Your results indicate that you experience a significant difficulty to identify those elements of a problem that are necessary for its solution and to arrive at a correct answer. This means that you have a bigger difficulty compared to the reference group in perceiving the logical patterns and relationships between numbers, in understanding the rules that govern these patterns and in deducing the logical consequences of these rules. You often need to spend a lot of effort and time in order to get along with complex mathematical problems and you avoid courses or occupations where a high level of mathematical ability is required. </p>

        <p>Ways to improve your performance in numerical reasoning tests and your numerical skills in general could include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Spend some time to focus on the question and make sure you understand what you are being asked to do</li>
          <li>Identify patterns that are useful to complete other similar questions</li>
          <li>Revise basic arithmetic principles and equations if needed</li>
          <li>Break the question into smaller, more manageable pieces to help you better understand what you need to do</li>
          <li>Practice equations and functions with and without calculator</li>

        <p>The numerical reasoning test assesses your ability to use numbers in a logical and rational way. The test consists of items which assess the candidate’s understanding of number series, numerical transformations, relationships between numbers and figures and their ability to perform numerical computations. Your score on this test was in the average range regarding the accuracy of your answers and below average regarding the speed of completion. This means that you achieved the same score as the rest of the reference group but you needed more time than the rest of the group with the same score to complete it. Your results indicate that you find it relatively easy to identify those elements of a problem that are necessary for its solution and to arrive at a correct answer but maybe struggle a little to understand more complex numerical and mathematical ideas. 
        Overall you cope fairly well when you need to perceive the logical patterns and relationships between numbers, understand the rules that govern these patterns and deduce the logical consequences of these rules. You have the potential to get along with mathematical problems and courses or occupations where a good level of mathematical ability is required, although you are rather more interested in other fields which do not require high level of numerical skills.</p>

        <p>The numerical reasoning test assesses your ability to use numbers in a logical and rational way. The test consists of items which assess the candidate’s understanding of number series, numerical transformations, relationships between numbers and figures and their ability to perform numerical computations. Your score on this test was in the average range regarding both the accuracy of your answers and the speed of completion. This means that you achieved the same score and in the same time as the rest of the reference group with the same score. Your results indicate that you find it relatively easy to identify those elements of a problem that are necessary for its solution and to arrive at a correct answer but maybe struggle a little to understand more complex numerical and mathematical ideas. 
        Overall you cope fairly well when you need to perceive the logical patterns and relationships between numbers, understand the rules that govern these patterns and deduce the logical consequences of these rules. You have the potential to get along with mathematical problems and courses or occupations where a good level of mathematical ability is required, although you are rather more interested in other fields which do not require high level of numerical skills.</p>

        <p>The spatial test assesses your ability to visualize abstract visual objects in different positions in two or three-dimensional space and to be able to identify critical differences among alternatives. The test consists of items which assess the candidate's understanding of how an object would look if rotate in space and quickly and automatically use visual processes to identify relationships between patterns of different dimensions. Your score on this test was relatively low compared to the reference group. Your results indicate that you experienced a significant difficulty compared to the chosen reference group to detect different size, angle and position differences, recognize objects that have been rotated and manipulate 3D objects or images in a reasonable way. You often need to spend a lot of effort and time in order to get along with complex spatial relations problems and you avoid courses or occupations that high level of spatial visual ability is required, such as architecture, design or even dentistry. However, you should be able to benefit from training materials where you will have the chance to practice your spatial and visualization skills.</p>
